## Project description

This project took side A and side B of a right triangle from the user. Then, using Pythagoreans' theorem
it calculates the hypotenuse and also calculates the surface area. 

## How to compiles / run the program

Navigate to the correct directory and compile and run using this command:

```bash
python rightTriangle.py
```

## Design

When the program first runs it outputs the calculations based on a pre-determined side A and side B.
From there it asks the user to input their desired side A and then it asks for their side B. Listed out
after the inputs is the calculated hypotenuse and surface area for the respective right triangle.
