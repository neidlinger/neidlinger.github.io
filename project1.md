## Project description

This was an exercise to expand and test knowledge of read/write abilities to external files in Perl as well as reading those values into a hash table. 

## How to compiles / run the program

Navigate to the correct directory and compile and run using this command:

```bash
./lab04.pl
```

## Design

This project used a hash table in Perl to store input from a given .txt file. Then the program sorted the inputted scores and printed the results to a new .txt file. From there the program took the highest score and calculated the average of all the scores and entered those values into a new .txt file for each. Figure 1 shows what happens when you run the program. It creates three .txt files with the sorted list(Figure 3), highest score, and average score (Figure 2).
